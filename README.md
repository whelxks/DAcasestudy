# DA Case Study: Bellabeat

## Introduction ##
* Mission: a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women

* About: Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. Their current marketing strategies include: 
  * **Traditional advertising media**, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively
  * **Google Search**, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter.
  * **Video ads** on Youtube and **display ads** on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

* Business goals: Bellabeat aims to become a larger player in the global **smart device** market. By analyzing smart device fitness data, we could potentially unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

## Data analysis process (6 steps): ##
1. Ask
* Identify the business task
I have been asked to analyze smart device data (data collected on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health). 
This helps me to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices (consumer's health status and habits) by making predictions and searching for trends and patterns.
Using this information, I will then craft high-level recommendations for how these trends can be applied to Bellabeat's products, customers to make their marketing strategy more effective.

* Consider Key Stakeholders
 * Primary Stakeholders: Urška Sršen (CEO of Bellabeats) & Sando Mur (co-founder of Bellabeats)
 * Secondary Stakeholder: Bellabeat marketing analytics team.
    

2. Prepare 
I will be using the public data from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). There are 15 csv files downloaded.
